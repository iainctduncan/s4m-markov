Notes on piece structure

- at 110, 17.5 sec per 8 bars - 6 min is 20 8bars

- 4,7,8, sound cool together

- popping up 2 or 7 between octaves later is nice
- turning off 1 later is cool with 2 and 7  up high , maybe end that way

- nice background is long reverb cranked on 8 with slow sweeps of res and FC
  - automate fc and fq from csound
  - great as background breaking into self osc
