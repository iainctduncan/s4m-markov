Notes on making a fucking piece


- working on 4
- will have each of four players take 2 lines (plus bass from someones foot, or recorded)
- solos happen and drop out two lines during them

- next:
- try some chord lines
- sop sax 

Notes on redux
- s1 & s2 stay exact same until the transition - that could be the voice that gets chords?
  - or could have some more variety inserted
  - definitely playable 
- s3 / 4 is slow but much more cutup
- 5 & 6 together doable but sounds hard
- 7 & 8 easy together

s1 & s3 seem playable
2 & 4 are playable together
