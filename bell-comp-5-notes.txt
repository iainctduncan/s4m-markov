Notes on the microtonal composition

- todo add functions for rotating lists!

- figure out process for allowing fade in of notes

- have five good lines now
- would be good to have chord changes

- s6 kinda belongs with the first two right now

Next:
- figure out how to do chord changes (in the score)
- figure out how to gradually change single notes

- base amp thing should be a multiplier so
  we can also fade in seqs with a process



Harmon notes:

- alternating between these two is smooth
  :pitch-seq    '((1) (7/6) (4/3) (7/4) )
  :pitch-seq    '((1) (7/6) (3/2) (7/4) )


- using 9/7 as a root works (sep M3)
- septimal maj 2: 8/7
- or sept 3rd over the 7th, (7/4 9/7)
