Notes on the microtonal composition

- todo add functions for rotating lists!

- figure out process for allowing fade in of notes

- have five good lines now
- would be good to have chord changes

- s6 kinda belongs with the first two right now

Next:
- figure out how to do chord changes (in the score)
- figure out how to gradually change single notes

- base amp thing should be a multiplier so
  we can also fade in seqs with a process



Harmon notes:

- alternating between these two is smooth
  :pitch-seq    '((1) (7/6) (4/3) (7/4) )
  :pitch-seq    '((1) (7/6) (3/2) (7/4) )


- using 9/7 as a root works (sep M3)
- septimal maj 2: 8/7
- or sept 3rd over the 7th, (7/4 9/7)


- made two chords that work for a modal change
  c-1 and c-2
- working on s3, made a nice long line
  works over c-1 and c2

- dropping out s-1 or s2 works over 3/4 together  

- need to work on chord change for s3 or something too
- s5 not finished, doesn't work over chord 2 yet

- Left off, chord 2 for s3 and s5
- s5 works just going to the fourth for chord 2 


Process Possibilities
---------------------
Alternate between two chords for long chunks
- have each line slowly change to new chord one note at a time?

- a potential process is each instruments line gets longer 
  and longer?? let's try that
